Propose a new change - create the change and generate all artifacts in one step.

I'll create a change with artifacts:
- proposal.md (what & why)
- specs/ (behavioral requirements)
- design.md (how)
- tasks.md (implementation steps)

When ready to implement, run /spec:apply

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" -> `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Validate the change name**

   The name must be kebab-case: lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only. No leading or trailing hyphens. No spaces or uppercase.

   Good: `add-dark-mode`, `fix-export-bug`, `user-auth-v2`
   Bad: `Add-Dark-Mode`, `add dark mode`, `-leading`, `trailing-`

3. **Check initialization and existing changes**

   - Verify `.specify/config.yaml` exists. If not, tell the user to run `/spec:init` first.
   - Read `.specify/config.yaml` to determine the project schema (look for `schema: <name>`). Default to `omnia` if not found.
   - Check if `.specify/changes/<name>/` already exists. If so, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one with a different name.

4. **Create the change directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .specify/changes/<name>/specs
   ```

   Write `.specify/changes/<name>/.metadata.yaml` using the schema read from config:
   ```yaml
   schema: <schema_from_config>
   created_at: <current ISO-8601 timestamp>
   ```

5. **Read project config for context and rules**

   Read `.specify/config.yaml` to get:
   - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in artifact output)
   - `rules`: Per-artifact rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in artifact output)

6. **Create artifacts in dependency order**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   The artifact dependency graph is:
   ```
   proposal (no dependencies)
      |
      +---> specs (requires: proposal)
      |
      +---> design (requires: proposal)
               |
               +---> tasks (requires: specs + design)
   ```

   Create artifacts in this order: **proposal** -> **specs** + **design** -> **tasks**

   For each artifact:
   - Read any completed dependency files for context
   - Read the corresponding reference file from `references/` (e.g., `references/proposal.md`) to get the Template and Instruction.
   - Create the artifact file using that content.
   - Apply `context` and `rules` from config.yaml as constraints -- but do NOT copy them into the file
   - Verify the file exists after writing before proceeding to next

   ### Artifact: proposal

   **Reference**: `references/proposal.md`
   **Write to**: `.specify/changes/<name>/proposal.md`

   ---

   ### Artifact: specs

   **Reference**: `references/spec.md`
   **Write to**: `.specify/changes/<name>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` (one per capability)

   ---

   ### Artifact: design

   **Reference**: `references/design.md`
   **Write to**: `.specify/changes/<name>/design.md`

   ---

   ### Artifact: tasks

   **Reference**: `references/tasks.md`
   **Write to**: `.specify/changes/<name>/tasks.md`

7. **Show final status**

   After completing all artifacts, summarize:
   - Change name and location
   - List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
   - What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
   - Prompt: "Run `/spec:apply` or ask me to implement to start working on the tasks."

**Guardrails**
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (proposal, specs, design, tasks)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user -- but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` from config.yaml are constraints for YOU, not content for the file. Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into any artifact.
